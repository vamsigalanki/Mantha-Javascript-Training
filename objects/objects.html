what is object?
In JavaScript, an object is a collection of related data and functionality, organized as key-value pairs.

ex:
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script>
            let person = {
                    name: "John",    // Property (key-value pair)
                    age: 30,         // Property
                    phone:9010182336,
            }
            console.log(person.name)
        </script>
    </body>
