                //2.string:Represents sequences of characters, enclosed in single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`).

                //4.undefined:A variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value yet has the type undefined.
                   let x;
                   console.log(x);

                //5.Null:Represents the intentional absence of any object value. null is different from undefined.
                   let y=null;

                //6.symbol:Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as keys for object properties to prevent naming collisions.
                     let sym = Symbol("unique");

                //7.BigInt:Used to represent integers larger than the Number type can safely handle (which is up to 2^53 - 1).
                    let bigInt = 9007199254740991n; // A BigInt number
