what is variable?

In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values.
JavaScript provides three keywords for declaring variables: 
1.var, 
2.let, and
 3.const.

 Global scope:If a variable  is declared outside of any function or block, it has global scope and can be accessed anywhere in the program.
    ex:var x;

 function scope:Variables declared inside a function with var are limited to that function and cannot be accessed outside.
        ex:let y;

 Block scope:Variables declared with let or const inside a block (like an if statement or loop) are scoped to that block.
        ex: let,const
