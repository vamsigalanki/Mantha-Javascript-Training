            //1.Addition: add two numbers together.
            let a = 10;
            let b = 5;
            let result = a + b; // result is 15

            //2.subtraction:subtracts the second number from the first
            let c = 10;
            let d = 5;
            let results = c - d; // results is 5

            //3.Multiplication: it multiples two numbers.
            let e = 10;
            let f = 5;
            let resultss = e * f; // resultss is 50.

             let outpuet=i%j; //output=1; (its reaminder).

               let ab=2;
               let bc=3;
               let finals=ab**bc; // finals is 8;(2 raised the power of 3).

              //7. increment : increase a number by one.
                //pre-increment(++x):it increments the value before using it
                let x=5;
                let final =++x; // final is 6;x is now 6

                //post increment(x++): uses the value before incrementing
                 let y =5;
                 let finl=y++; // result is 5,y is now 6

               //  Decrement (--):Decreases a number by one.
                 //Pre-decrement (--xy): Decrements the value before using it.
               
                 let xy=5;
                 let resu= --xy; //result is 4,xy is now 4;

                 // Post-decrement (yz--): Uses the value before decrementing.
                   let yz=5;
                   let resul= yz--; // result is 4,
