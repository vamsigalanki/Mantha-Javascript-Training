          //1.Equal to (==):   if two values are equal. It performs type conversion if necessary.
           let a=5;
           let b="5" ;
           console.log(a==b); // output is true.

           //2.strict equal to(===):if two values are equal and of the same type. It does not perform type conversion.

             let d="5" ;
