            //1.Assignment operator(=):ssigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
             let x=10; 
             console.log(x); // output is 10;

             //2.addition assignment(+=):Adds the value on the right to the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.
             let a = 10;
             a += 5; // a = a + 5
            console.log(a); // Output: 15;
             
            //3.Subtraction assignment(-=):Subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.
               let c=10;
               c -=3; //c=c-3
               console.log(c); //output is 7;

            //4.multiplication assignment(*=):Multiplies the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.
              let d=10;
              d *= 2 //d =d*2
              console.log(d) //output=20;

            //5.division assignment(/=): Divides the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.
             let e =10;
             e /=2; //e=e/2;
             console.log(e) //output=5;

             //6. modulus assignment(%=):Calculates the remainder when the variable on the left is divided by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable
              let f=10;
              f %=3; //f=f%3
              console.log(f) //output is 1;

             //7.exponentiation assignment(**=): Raises the variable on the left to the power of the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.
               let g=2;
               g**=3; //g=g**3
               console.log(g) //output 8
