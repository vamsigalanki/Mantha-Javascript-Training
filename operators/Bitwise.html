Bitwise Operators :-
We use bitwise operators to perform binary operations on integers.

         // 1. Bitwise AND (&):bitwise AND operation, where each bit of the result is 1 if both corresponding bits of the operands are 1; otherwise, it's 0.
         let a = 5;   // 0101 in binary
         let b = 3;   // 0011 in binary

         let result = a & b; // 0101 & 0011 = 0001 (1 in decimal)
         console.log(result); // Output: 1
           
         //2.Bitwise OR (|):bitwise OR operation, where each bit of the result is 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1.
         let c = 5;   // 0101 in binary
         let d = 3;   // 0011 in binary

         let results = c | d; // 0101 | 0011 = 0111 (7 in decimal)
         console.log(results); // Output: 7.

         //3.Bitwise XOR (^):bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation, where each bit of the result is 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different, and 0 if they are the same.
         let e = 5;   // 0101 in binary
         let f = 3;   // 0011 in binary

         let resul = e ^ f; // 0101 ^ 0011 = 0110 (6 in decimal)
         console.log(resul); // Output: 6

         //4.Bitwise NOT (~):bitwise NOT operation, which inverts all the bits of the operand (i.e., changes 1 to 0 and 0 to 1).
         let g = 5;   // 0101 in binary

         let output = ~g; // ~0101 = 1010 (in binary, this represents -6 in decimal due to two's complement)
         console.log(output); // Output: -6

         //5.Bitwise Left Shift (<<):Shifts the bits of the first operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the second operand. The vacant bits on the right are filled with 0.
         let h = 5;   // 0101 in binary

         let outp = h << 1; // 0101 << 1 = 1010 (10 in decimal)
         console.log(putp); // Output: 10


         //6.Bitwise Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of the first operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the second operand. The vacant bits on the left are filled with the sign bit (0 for positive numbers and 1 for negative numbers).

         let i = 5;   // 0101 in binary

         let resultn = i >> 1; // 0101 >> 1 = 0010 (2 in decimal)
         console.log(resultn); // Output: 2


         //7. Bitwise Zero-Fill Right Shift (>>>):Shifts the bits of the first operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the second operand. The vacant bits on the left are always filled with 0, regardless of the sign.
         let j = -5;  // 11111111111111111111111111111011 in binary (32-bit signed integer)

         let resultl = j >>> 1; // 11111111111111111111111111111011 >>> 1 = 01111111111111111111111111111101 (2147483645 in decimal)
         console.log(resultl); // Output: 2147483645
